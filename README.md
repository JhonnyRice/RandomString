# RandomString
A small library for python that generates random strings.
You can use this small library for speeding up your work, in case you need to generate some random strings.
(even tho you can just create your own)


# Install

just click download zip, extract it & after that you can easly import it with ``` import RandomString ```

# How it works

To use the library, you need to assign one of the functions listed below inside a variable, and then reference the variable, like this:
```py
#assign to the variable a function
variable = RandomString.GenerateRandomString(10)

#use the function trough the variable
print(variable)
```
These are the various functions:

``` GenerateRandomString(lenght) ```
Generates a random string containing both uppercase and lowercase letters.

``` GenerateRandomNumber(lenght) ```
Kinda self explanatory. Generates a random number from 0 to 9.

``` GenerateRandomLowercaseString(lenght) ```
Generates a random string containing only lowercase letters.


``` GenerateRandomUppercaseString(lenght) ```
Generates a random string containing only uppercase letters.

```GenerateRandomPassword(lenght)```
Generates a cool little password featuring lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and some symbols!
