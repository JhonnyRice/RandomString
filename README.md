# RandomString
A small library for python that generates random strings.
You can use this small library for speeding up your work, in case you need to generate some random strings.
(even tho you can just create your own)


# Install

just click download zip and extract it

# How it works

you can import it with ``` import RandomString ``` and the commands are these:

``` GenerateRandomString(lenght) ```
Generates a random string containing both uppercase and lowercase letters

``` GenerateRandomNumber(lenght) ```
Kinda self explanatory. Generates a random number from 0 to 9.

``` GenerateRandomLowercaseString(lenght) ```
Basically the first one but returns only lowercase letters.


``` GenerateRandomUppercaseString(lenght) ```
The previous one but uppercase.

```GenerateRandomPassword(lenght)```
Generates a cool little password featuring lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and some symbols!
